# 🎓 Virtual Mathematics Lab – Grade 12

This virtual lab was developed for the **Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), India**, as part of a national initiative to create **interactive educational tools** for high school students. Our focus was on **Grade 12 Mathematics**, specifically concepts related to number lines, equations, and inequalities.

This tool is designed to help students **visualize and better understand mathematical concepts** through interactive simulations and clear visual representations.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The project consists of **five interactive modules**, each focusing on a key mathematical concept:

### 1. 📍 Number Line Visualizations  
This module introduces basic **number line operations**. It helps students visualize numbers, intervals, and positioning on a number line—an essential skill for grasping algebra and inequalities.

### 2. ➕ Inequality on a Number Line (Single Axis)  
Students can explore **inequalities with a single variable**, plotted on a number line. It demonstrates open/closed intervals and visually distinguishes between `<`, `≤`, `>` and `≥`.

### 3. 📈 Plotting Linear Equations with One Variable  
In this module, learners can graph **simple equations involving one variable**. The visual feedback reinforces the connection between algebraic expressions and their graphical representations.

### 4. ✖️ Plotting Linear Equations with Two Variables  
This section helps students plot **linear equations in two variables** on a Cartesian plane. Concepts like slope, intercept, and direction become intuitive through interaction and visualization.

### 5. 🔺 Visualizing Inequalities with Three Variables  
This advanced module uses **3D graphs** to display inequalities involving three variables. Students can rotate, zoom, and explore the space to better understand how planes divide 3D space based on algebraic constraints.
